# SQL
Playing with SQL and python. Virtually every relational database uses some form of the standard SQL adopted by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Standards Organization (ISO). No database system implements the standard exactly, as each have their own flavor to leverage their own features, but since they all comply with the standard, the work you do in SQLite will be easily transferable to the more fully featured relational database systems available.

Goals:

  - Learn the basics of relational databases and how to write Structured Query Language (SQL) queries to access the data.
  
  - Install and setup SQLite on your computer and create a basic table.
  
  - Interact with a database using Python.
